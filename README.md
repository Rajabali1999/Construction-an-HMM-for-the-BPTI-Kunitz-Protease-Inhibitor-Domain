# Construction an HMM for the BPTI Kunitz-Protease Inhibitor Domain
This repository implements a pipeline to detect the BPTI/Kunitz protease inhibitor domain (PF00014) using profile HMMs. It integrates structural bioinformatics and sequence modeling to build a structure-guided HMM and compare its performance to a standard MSA-based HMM, testing whether structure improves detection. in real proteins across datasets
